#Personal Website#
This is going to be part of my personal brand as an IT consultant and Digital Humanities lecturer. I'm making it to brush up on my web design / web dev skills and to familiarize myself with new technologies.

For the time being, it is mostly going to be plain HTML and CSS, with a hint of JavaScript.
